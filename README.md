# üï∏Ô∏è itsy.bitsy üï∏Ô∏è

`itsy.bitsy` is a library for working with and manipulating bits. It comes with 3 different pertinent abstraction layers:

- Bit Sequences
  - A family of types contained in the `bitsy::bit_sequence<Container>` class template.
  - Supports having reference wrapped containers as well, such as `bitsy::bit_sequence<std::reference_wrapper<Container>>`.
- Bit Ranges
  - A family of types contained in the `bitsy::bit_view<Range, Bounds>` class template.
  - `Range` can be any range type. For the class to work efficiently and keep with the ideals set out in `std::ranges`, it should be a non-owning range.
  - `Bounds` can be any type that provides a `begin_position(const R&)` and `end_position(const R&)` functions, or just one of the default ones contained in the library such as `bitsy::bit_bounds<FirstN, LastN>`, `bitsy::word_bit_bounds`, or `bitsy::dynamic_bit_bounds`.
- Bit Iterators
  - An iterator over a bits of a `word` type. A `word` type is one of the fundamental integer types, character type, or enumeration types.
  - Contains `bitsy::bit_iterator` `bitsy::bit_reference`, `bitsy::bit_pointer`, and `bitsy::bit_value` types as well.



# Using the Library

Each higher layer of this library builds on top of the lower layers. We will start at the top -- with wrapping, owning containers -- and progress steadily downward. The library is also a header-only, linker-hassle free library. It is straightforward to either add the include paths [include/](https://github.com/ThePhD/itsy_bitsy/tree/master/include), or include the CMake of the top-level directory by using `add_subdirectory`.


## Bit Sequence

`bitsy::bit_sequence<Container>` is an owning sequence container adaptor. It can be used like so:

```cpp
#include <itsy/bitsy.hpp>

#include <cassert>

int main () {
	// construct with initializer list
	bitsy::bit_sequence<std::vector<std::size_t>> bits{
		false, true, true, false, false
	};
	// construct from iterators just like other containers
	bitsy::bit_sequence<std::vector<std::size_t>> other_bits(
		bits.cbegin(), bits.cend();
	);

	// can compare
	assert(bits == other_bits);
	assert(!(bits != other_bits));

	// insertion
	bits.push_back(false);
	bits.insert(bits.begin() + 2, {true, true});
	assert(bits.size() == 8);
	assert(bits.count(true) == 4);

	// erasure
	bits.erase(bits.begin() + 1, bits.begin() + 3);
	assert(bits.size() == 6);
	assert(bits.popcount() == 2);

	// comparison works exactly the same
	assert(bits != other_bits);
	assert(!(bits == other_bits));

	return 0;
}
```

There is a convenience alias -- `bitsy::dynamic_bitset<T, Allocator>`, which defaults to some `std::vector<T, Allocator>`-alike storage. See the below section on [future work with small buffers](#small-buffer) for additional containers for the hope of what the default choice of container for this convenience alias should use:

```cpp
#include <itsy/bitsy.hpp>

int main () {
	bitsy::dynamic_bitset<std::size_t> bits{false, true, true, false, false};

	/* bit work here! */

	return 0;
}
```

Additionally, one can move storage directly into the bit sequence by using the `std::in_place` constructors:

```cpp
#include <itsy/bitsy.hpp>

#include <cstdint>
#include <cassert>

int main () {
	std::vector<std::uint32_t> words{ 0xff00ff00, 0xff00ff00 };
	bitsy::bit_sequence<std::vector<std::uint32_t>> bits(std::in_place, std::move(words));

	const std::size_t bits_size = bits.size();
	
	// size of the container is 2 words
	assert(bits_size == bitsy::binary_digits_v<std::uint32_t> * 2);
	assert(bits_size == 64);

	// assert 16-bit pattern
	for (std::size_t index = 0; index < bits_size; ++index) {
		if ((index % 16) < 8) {
			assert(!bits[index]);
		}
		else {
			assert(bits[index]);
		}
	}

	return 0;
}
```


## Bit View

The types at this layer sit below `bit_sequence` in terms of abstraction power. `bit_view<Range, Bounds>` is the type which views a set of bits and provides a potentially mutable view of those bits. It cannot `insert`/`erase` into the underlying range, but supports in-place modifications and mutability. For example, if the `Range` is a `std::span<T>`, then the type is mutable:

```cpp
#include <itsy/bitsy.hpp>

#include <string>
#include <span>
#include <cassert>

int main () {
	std::string str = "Howdy!";
	std::cout << str << std::endl;
	// arguments get forwarded directly
	// to underlying range constructor
	bitsy::bit_view<std::span<char>> str_bits(str);

	// iterators
	auto bits_it = str_bits.begin();
	assert(bits_it.position() == 0);
	assert(*bits_it == bitsy::bit0);
	++bits_it;
	assert(bits_it.position() == 1);
	assert(*bits_it == bitsy::bit0);
	bits_it += 4;
	assert(bits_it.position() == 5);
	assert(*bits_it == bitsy::bit0);
	// flip a single bit
	// pointed to by `bits_it`
	bits_it->flip();
	assert(*bits_it == bitsy::bit1);

	// we flipped the ASCII bit
	// for a capital letter!
	std::cout << str << std::endl;
	assert(str == "howdy!");

	return 0;
}
```

But if the `Range` is something like a `std::string_view` or a `std::span<const T>`, whose iterators and interface is immutable, `bit_view` becomes immutable as well:

```cpp
#include <itsy/bitsy.hpp>

#include <cassert>

#include <span>
#include <cstdint>

int main() {
	std::vector<std::uint16_t> storage{ 0, 0, 0 };
	bitsy::bit_view<std::span<const std::uint16_t>> bits(storage);

	assert(bits.size() == 48);

	// the below will trigger a compiler error,
	// thus preserving const-safety
	(*bits.begin()) = true;
	bits[16] = bitsy::bit1;
	bits.begin()->flip();

	// can use auto, just showing the actual type
	for (bitsy::bit_reference<const std::uint16_t&> bit_ref : bits) {
		bit_value value = bit_ref;
		assert(value.value()); // returns the `bool` value
		// cannot use mutable methods: 
		// compiler will error below!
		bit_ref.flip();
		bit_ref.set();
		bit_ref.reset();
	}

	return 0;
}
```

For `bit_view`, the optional second `Bounds` template parameter can be used to specify very specific extents:

```cpp
#include <itsy/bitsy.hpp>

#include <string_view>
#include <cassert>

int main () {
	std::array<std::uint32_t, 2> storage{
		// 0xFBFF;
		// (MSB) 0b‚Ä≠1111101111111111‚Ä¨ (LSB)
		0x0000FBFF, 
		0xFFFFFFFF 
	};
	using range_t = std::basic_string_view<std::uint32_t>;
	using bounds_t = bitsy::bit_bounds<10, 22>;
	bitsy::bit_view<range_t, bounds_t> view_specific_bits(
		storage.data(), storage.size()
	);

	assert(view_specific_bits.size() == 12);
	// 0th bit of biew is 10th bit,
	// 10th bit of 0xFBFF is false
	assert(view_specific_bits[0] == bitsy::bit0);

	return 0;
}
```

And, as previously stated, it can be used at compile-time and in constant-evaluated contexts:

```cpp
#include <itsy/bitsy.hpp>

#include <string_view>
#include <cassert>

int main () {
	static constexpr unsigned data[] = { 0b0001, 0b0010 };
	static constexpr bitsy::bit_view<std::basic_string_view<unsigned>> data_bits(&data[0], 2);

	static_assert(data_bits[0], "First bit is not true (expected: true)!");
	static_assert(!data_bits.test(1), "Second bit is true  (expected: false)!");
	static_assert(*(data_bits.begin() + bitsy::binary_digits_v<unsigned> + 1),
	  "Second bit in second word is not true (expected: true)!");
	static_assert(data_bits.size() == (sizeof(unsigned) * CHAR_BIT * 2),
	  "The size of the bit view is not 2 x unsigned");
	static_assert(data_bits.size() == (bitsy::binary_digits_v<unsigned> * 2),
	  "The size of the bit view is not 2 x unsigned");
	static_assert(!data_bits[3].value(), "The bit is true (expected: false)!");

	return 0;
}
```

All methods found on a `bit_view` also exist on all variants of `bit_sequence`.


## Bit Iterator

`bitsy::bit_iterator<Iterator>` is a class template. It is considered the "low level" portion of this library. It takes an iterator to increment when it iterates from `[ 0, bitsy::binary_digits_v<underlying_value_type> )`. Generally, what that means is that a `std::uint32_t` will iterate from 0 to 31 inclusive, an `unsigned long long` (depending on platform specifics) might go from 0 to 63 inclusive, and so on and so forth. This can be inspected with the `.position()` and `.mask()` properties:

```cpp
#include <itsy/bitsy.hpp>

#include <random>
#include <limits>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
	using sequence = std::list<int>;
	sequence seq{ 100, 0 };
	std::random_device rd{};
	std::default_random_engine rand_engine(rd());
	std::uniform_int_distribution<int> rand_distribution(
	  std::numeric_limits<int>::max() - 32, std::numeric_limits<int>::max());
	std::generate_n(seq.begin(), seq.size(), [&]() { return rand_distribution(rand_engine); });

	bitsy::bit_iterator<typename sequence::const_iterator> first(seq.cbegin(), 0);
	bitsy::bit_iterator<typename sequence::const_iterator> last(seq.cend(), 0);

	if (auto it = std::find(first, last, bitsy::bit0); it != last) {
		bitsy::bit_reference<typename sequence::const_reference> ref = *it;
		std::cout << "Found a 0 bit at the " << std::distance(it, last) << " element in the "
							<< seq.size() << ", at bit position" << ref.position() << "( mask: " << ref.mask()
							<< " | applied to value: " << *it.base() << ")" << std::endl;
	}

	return 0;
}
```


Its `value_type` is a `bit_value`, and its reference type is a `bit_reference<WordType, MaskType>`. `bit_reference` keeps on the reference and the position/mask value. `bit_value` discards the reference and mask type, and only represents a single bit value. As seen from the above example, using the basic `bit_iterator` API is verbose. Use of the top-level ranges API or similar when possible is **highly** encouraged. This layer is generally only useful for catching function overloads, or for creating your own ranges/containers that iterate over bits.


# Testing

Testing can be turned on by using `ITSY_BITSY_TESTS`, and examples will also be tested if `ITSY_BITSY_EXAMPLES` is turned on. The tests do not take long to run at all on both Debug or Release. The tests also have dependencies, which can be automatically obtained with `git submodule update --init`.



# Benchmarks

There is an extensive benchmarking suite contained in this repository. It can be turned on by setting `ITSY_BITSY_BENCHMARKS` when building the library. It requires a few dependencies to run, which can be obtained by making sure the repository has its dependencies set with `git submodule update --init` in the cloned directory.

## Visual C++

These are the numbers using Visual C++ (Visual Studio 16.2.3). Note that the performance here might not be as great. In order to preserve constexpr, we could not use intrinsics in VC++ because none of their intrinsics are constexpr. Their compiler does not have `std::is_constant_evaluated()` in any form, which makes it impossible to use low-level, fast functions in MSVC for the algorithms and other places without giving constexpr the guillotine. Hopefully, the situation on that front will improve and we will get better constexpr-related goodies in the releases to come.

# Future Work

There are quite a lot of optimizations, additional underlying data structures, general improvements, and other things to do here.


## Better non-constexpr bit intrinsic calculations

MSVC has issues with `constexpr` and their intrinsics, and they do not yet have `std::is_constant_evaluated`. As such, the `bitsy::first(l/r)_(zero/one)`, `bitsy::count(l/r)_(zero/one)` and `bitsy::popcount` intrinsic functions -- while `constexpr` -- are also implemented in some of the most braindead and plain manners possible. It would be nice to add `if constexpr()` blocks for implementations in the `__basic_X` version of these functions that use smarter bit twiddling tricks. This is done for one of the intrinsics, but should be extended to the others.

GCC and Clang only use the `__basic_X` loop versions if the type is too big to fit in one of their `unsigned`, `unsigned long`, or `unsigned long long` intrinsics.


## Putting It Directly in libc++ Too

The 2019 Google Summer of Code saw this library having an implementation placed towards libstdc++. The patch is out, and progress will hopefully be made over the coming months to get a version of it firmly in libstdc++ and fully integrated.

It would be nice to make much of the same available in libc++ as well, with the goal of improving the bit iterator situation there. There is no prior art for doing such a thing; libc++ is not one for many extensions, unlike libstdc++ which features quite a few extended features. Perhaps performance data can persuade them that having a concrete `bit_iterator` exposed by this library would be highly beneficial to them.


## Strong Exception Safety

Currently, `basic_bit_sequence` does not exhibit strong exception safety (not because the library tries and fails, it just doesn't `try`). This is something that should probably fixed soon, to make sure this is usable in exception-heavy code.

Likewise, the code should also be usable in a `-fno-exceptions` situation. It likely currently is (because of the lack of `try` or `catch` employed), but it should be explicitly checked over.


## Small Buffer

It has been a long time coming, and this bit library makes it all the more apparent and useful. There needs to be two additional container types implemented (and, perhaps in the future, proposed to the standard):

- `template <typename T, std::size_t BufferWords, typename Allocator> small_bit_buffer;`
  - This class provides the "small buffer optimization" with a customizable buffer size to be stored with the container, with the exception that this keeps track of its size by-the-bit and prevents a `value_type` of `bitsy::bit_value`.
  - `small_bit_buffer<T, 0, Allocator>` is morally and functionally equivalent in iterator guarantees and storage requirements as `std::vector<bool>`, just without the ugly specialization of `vector`.
  - Otherwise, `small_bit_buffer<T, N, Allocator>` produces a type which buffers up to `N` elements of type `T` in some implementation-defined manner while maintaining a `.size()` internally as the number of bits rather than the number of words. Iterator invalidation rules change and become similar to `std::basic_string`'s iterator invalidation rules.
- `template <typename T, std::size_t BufferWords, typename Allocator> small_buffer;`
  - This class provides the "small buffer optimization" with a customizable buffer size to be stored with the container.
  - `small_buffer<T, 0, Allocator>` is morally and functionally equivalent in iterator guarantees and storage requirements as `std::vector<T>`.
  - Otherwise, `small_buffer<T, N, Allocator>` produces a type which buffers up to `N` elements of type `T` in some implementation-defined manner. Iterator invalidation rules change and become similar to `std::basic_string`'s iterator invalidation rules.

Once these types exist, they can be used as the default backing storage of `bit_sequence`/`dynamic_bitset<T>`.


## Optimization Work

- There is a need to make the `bit_equal` and `std::equal` algorithms perform just as fast as their `memcmp` counterparts. The answer why it does not optimize out as cleanly will likely lie in an analysis of both the output assembly and any intermediate representation available from the compiler (LLVM and GCC can help obtain this kind of information). See the benchmarks for more details.
- Optimizations for `bit_iterator<T>`s that have different underlying `It` types is very much pertinent to what is happening here. The optimizations are very much done plainly and only work on homogenous iterators; it would be great to work on `bit_iterator`s that do not view the same `value_type` in the slightest.
